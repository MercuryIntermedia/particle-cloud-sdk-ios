- Manage & inject user sessions for the Particle Cloud (access tokens, encrypted session management)
- Claim/Unclaim devices for a user account
- Get a list of Particle devices claimed by user
- Read variables from devices
- Invoke functions on devices
- Publish events from the mobile app and subscribe to events coming from devices
- Get data usage information for Electron devices
